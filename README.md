# Sorting algorithms

Implementation of Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Bucket, Comb, Shell, Merge & Quick sort.

### Performance comparison

`simulation-results.json` contains results  of testing Shell, Merge & Quick sort on all combinations of:
* Sequence lenght: 100 000, 500 000, 1 000 000, 2 000 000
* Sequence type: random, sorted descending, half-sorted, sorted
* [Gap sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort#Gap_sequences) (for Shell sort): Shell, Frank & Lazarus, Hibbard 

P.S. Simulation was performed on my laptop (Intel Core i5-8250U @ 1.60GHz, 8Gb RAM)
